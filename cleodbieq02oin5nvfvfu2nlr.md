# Software Design Patterns: An Overview and When to Use Them

Software design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They provide a way to structure code in a way that is scalable, maintainable, and flexible. In this post, we'll take a look at some common software design patterns and when to use them.

Singleton: The singleton pattern is used to ensure that a class has only one instance, and to provide a global point of access to that instance. This is useful when you want to make sure that only one instance of a resource or service is created, to avoid conflicts or duplication.

Factory: The factory pattern is used to create objects in a super class, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This is useful when you want to create objects that belong to a specific family, but you don't want to specify the exact class of object that will be created.

Observer: The observer pattern is used to define a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This is useful when you want to update multiple objects in response to a change in another object.

Decorator: The decorator pattern is used to add new behavior to an existing object dynamically. This is useful when you want to add functionality to an object without changing its implementation.

Command: The command pattern is used to encapsulate a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. This is useful when you want to abstract the details of a request and give it a separate object to handle it.

Conclusion

Software design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. By understanding and using these patterns, you can design more scalable, maintainable, and flexible code. It's important to choose the right design pattern for the problem at hand, as different patterns are better suited to different situations.
