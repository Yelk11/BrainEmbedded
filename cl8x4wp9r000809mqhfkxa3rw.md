# someone who has long since quit but decides to go another round for old time’s sake

tell me a story about someone who has long since quit but decides to go another round for old time’s sake. A story of a jaded, washed-out, burned-out guy that’s just going to give it another shot. Maybe go for a few rounds with the guy next door and try to save some lives. That’s more like it.

For me, the explanation behind the decline of the boxing game is simple. It’s the addiction these guys are suffering from. I mean, how many doctors can you call on a whim to treat your addiction?? Apparently, when you reach the point of a high-profile suicide or a public melt down, you’ve crossed the line to the other side of rehab.

Now, I’m not saying the addiction is good. I’m not even saying that it’s bad. I’m simply saying that for years, this has been the cost paid by these guys to get and stay in the game. You know, boxing and the drug, they’re like oil and water. They don’t mix. These guys take drugs and they’re addicted. They take diet pills and they’re addicted. They take alcohol and they’re addicted. They take steroids and they’re addicted. They drink and they’re addicted.

I know what I’m talking about. I was one of them.

Some of these guys have been dealing with the addiction for years. For them, it’s not like going to the doctor, getting a prescription and popping a pill. They’ve been there, done that and are just hoping for a second chance.

I didn’t go through any of that. I was always clean. I’m finding it hard enough to try to come to grips with hitting a guy on purpose after having been a passive participant in the sport for so many years. But, I still think that I can play the game of boxing. I can’t believe I’ve made it this far. But, I can’t believe I’m not going to make it to the end.

The guy next door? He’s easier to understand. He’s still angry enough at being there that he’s willing to try to get in a few lucky punches. He’s still willing to do it for the fans who are still willing to pay to see him. I’m not even going to say that some of these guys at the end of their ropes, like Roy Jones or Oscar De La Hoya, are still willing to throw the fight. I’m not even saying that they’re going to continue to climb the ladder just so that they can stay in the game, but at least they’re not suffering from a long, slow death.

I’m concerned for the fighter who has reached the point that his body is broken. When I was there, I was fortunate enough to be able to turn it around.
