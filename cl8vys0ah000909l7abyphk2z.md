# What is engineering?

When people ask me what do I do, I often reply with some over simplified answer.

"Im a glorified excel user"

But thats not the case, it is much more complicated than that. Being an engineer means that you both make things, but also make thing better (optimization). 

As an embedded software engineer I am faced with many challenges that my team and I overcome. Very little of it actually deals with writing software itself. 

When working with a team you need to have a way to share code and develop code together. Many people find that Git is a wonderful tool, and i find it more than capable of any task that my team sets out to accomplish. Git is a version control tool, which allows teams to make small incremental changes to a code base.

Along with git I like to use bitbucket and jira for issue tracking. Both these tools allow teams to identify and assign issues to be worked on by individual engineers.

Even within these tools are even more complicated parts of my job. In fact philosophy is even a huge part!

Scrum which is an agile methodology which is a way of working together to complete tasks. Jira utilizes this philosophy.

I hope I have given you a more accurate view of what an engineer does.
